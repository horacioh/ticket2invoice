## About the app

- https://github.com/horacioh/ticket2invoice
- I need a way to automate the process of requesting invoices to restaurants and coffee shops
- the app uses
  - React
  - react-query
  - AWS Amplify GraphQL API
  - AWS Cognito
  - AWS S3
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS SES

## DEMO!

## Experience

- It's awesome that I can build this with such low effort and be sure is scalable
- sometimes Amplify can be very complex... so be careful!
- having a community like this available for questions is key to the success to any service like AWS Amplify. thanks to all that offered me support! 🎉

## Next steps

- better design
- custom email that receives the invoices and submit it to my invoice system
- mark tickets as sent
- re-send emails
- Company login
- prepare it as a SaaS and create a business around it. I know others might need this
